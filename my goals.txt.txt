Hey guys, my name is Rasak Olanrewaju and I am about to take you guys on a vacation wey una no pay for, no worry nobody go kidnap una for road, it's a safe space here lol. I want to tell you all about my tech goals, grab some popcorn. You know, I like working with numbers, I love mathematics, infact, numbers make me happy than Chelsea beating Arsenal 5:0, so I have always wanted to do something in tech with numbers. So I found data analysis. It is a long journey but one which I am determined to see through. My goal is to attain efficient technical knowledge about data analysis, become a good data analyst and make meaningful contribution to the society with my data polls.
